CRUD App made with ReactJs as an Test Assignment for BonApp

### How to test

Install the node_modules first

`npm install`

You need to run React Development(port:3000) and JSON Server(port:5000) at the same time

`npm start` && `json-server --watch db.json --port 5000`

or since i installed concurrently you can run both at the same time with

'npm run dev'

## My Process

### Built with
